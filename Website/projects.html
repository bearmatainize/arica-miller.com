				<h2>Capstone Project - Android App UI</h2>
				<p class="project-description">
					The final class of my Computer Science major at UAlbany involves a team capstone project. This project is sponsored by either an internal or external sponsor.
					My team's sponsor, <a href="https://truthorerr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Truth or Err</a>, tasked us with creating a new UI for their gamified educational android app.
					Our goal was to make this UI more funtional, more user friendly, and appeal to all ages.
					<br><br>
					To the right you can see one of our example UI ideas. As the project is ongoing, our next step is to implement the wireframes we have created.
					We are utilizing Android Studio to code in Java.

				<h2> Sliding Puzzle Game</h2>
				<p class="project-description">
					For my System Fundamentals class we remade the classic sliding puzzle game in C.
					The goal of the game is to rearrange the numbers to be in order going left to right, top to bottom, with the bottom right being empty and top left being 1.
					My favorite part of the project is that the game board can vary in size, although this has presented some bugs I plan to fix in the future.
					Since the project was for a class I cannot share it publicly, but feel free to send me an email via Arica-Miller@outlook.com for access.

				<h2>Animal Crossing: New Horizons Google Sheet</h2>
				<p class="project-description">
					In the game Animal Crossing: New Horizons one the biggest goals is to complete the museum by donating all of the fish, bugs, fossils, paintings, and sculptures in the game.
					I wanted to reliably keep track of which of these I had already donated. Thus I created this google sheet.
					<br><br>
					In addition to keeping track of donations, I added additional information that was useful as well. Such as prices, location to find things, movement patterns, and size of fish.
					The game is based on the time and date in real life. Thus, the fish and bugs are able to be available both seasonally, and depending on the time.
					I used conditional formatting to indicate whether a fish or bug is currently available based on the current time and date.
					<br><br>
					The fish and bugs aren't all in the sheet though. The artwork you can donate is sold to you by a shady art dealer. So sometimes the art is fake!
					I also included a sheet that will help distinguish forgeries from the real deal. I added a couple extra sheets to track collections of K.K. Slider songs and reactions as well.
					<br><br>
					The very last sheet I included is a flower breeding guide. The flowers in the game have actual genetics, so if you want a certain color you need to breed your flowers a certain way.
					This includes the very rare and hard to breed blue rose.
					<br><br>
					Here is a link: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pSC53NGLp2ZgjgU9enmAK3IXcfrHKq7s_j_FhqKQTMU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Animal Crossing</a>!
					If you want to use it too you can copy it to your own Google Drive via file->Make a copy.
					Note that I last updated the sheet in late 2022, so some information might be inaccurate. Happy playing!

				<h2>Random Dice Roll Dinner</h2>
				<p class="project-description">
					Inspired by <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@d20dinner?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@d20dinner</a> on TikTok, I created a google sheet to assist in deciding on and making dinners on my own.
					The idea is that you roll a D6, 6 sided die, to choose a sheet. Then roll a D20, 20 sided die, to choose a food from that sheet.
					Generally the 20 rolls would be ordering food from a restaurant, or expensive meals. Then the 1 rolls would be foods you are scared to try, or cheaper meals.
					<br><br>
					I also added in some statistics on how many times each recipe had been rolled. These are automatically tallied up on the stats sheet.
					Once I start using it more often I hope to add a sheet for retired recipes to save their statistics, but take them out so they can't be rolled.
					<br><br>
					If this sounds like something you'd like to try here's a link to an empty version: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fS0qRtc1ULJYpjkQgB1A0zQXXHNlNWQNMbesZFIysmg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Random Dice Roll Dinner</a>.
					To actually edit it, copy it to your own Google Drive via file->Make a copy. If you don't have a D20 and/or D6 you can also use an online random number generator. Just type "Pick a number 1 to 20" into Google. Happy cooking!
					<br><br>

				<h2>This is Not a Two Player Game</h2>
				<p class="project-description">
					This is a game I made using Construct 3 for a Game Design and Development course. You can try it out right now: <a href="This is Not a Two Player Game/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This is Not a Two Player Game</a>.
					The goal was to get familiar with using Construct 3. The game is a basic platformer with obstacles including doors that need keys, lava, and sawblades.
					The twist is that there are two characters that you control at the same time. The goal of each world is to bring these two characters back together to become one again.
					<br><br>
					I hope to add more levels, and improve on the graphics in the future. This is the first computer game that I had ever made, and I hope I can keep making more.

				<h2>Minecraft Modding</h2>
				<p class="project-description">
					I am currently dabbling in Minecraft mod development. I haven't created a fully functioning mod yet, but I have been watching tutorials and learning about the process.
					I've always played Minecraft with mods, and I never knew how they were made until now. It has been a lot of fun to learn about and it's amazing how much information is out there about it.
					Modding Minecraft requies coding in Java, data manipulation in JSON, and Github for version control.
					<br><br>
					I have many ideas for what my modding project will be. We'll just have to wait to find out what the final product will end up being.

				<h2>This Website! (Plus some pages for my sister)</h2>
				<p class="project-description">
					Plus of course, I made this website! Here's the link to my GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/bearmatainize/arica-miller.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github.com/bearmatainize/arica-miller.com</a>.
					This is the first website I have made, and it has been a lot of fun. Throw in some Googling of "How to center..." with that fun as well.
					<br><br>
					My younger sister Evelyn was very excited that I was creating a website. Obviously as the best older sister ever I had to offer to make her a page.
					Which with her imagination turned into multiple pages. She wrote her own introduction, and did all the drawings herself. Here's a link to her pages: <a href="./Evelyn/evelyn-about.html" target="_blank">Evelyn's How to Draw Guide</a>
